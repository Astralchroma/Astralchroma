Hey, I'm Astralchroma.

Writer of questionable quality of Rust code, and former Lead Developer of [Horizon's End](https://horizonsend.net). Currently working on a Minecraft inspired Sci-Fi Space Exploration / Survival game written in Rust called [Solarscape](https://solarscape.astralchroma.dev/).

Honestly not sure what else to put here. lol

Other Minor Projects:
- [Aggregator](https://github.com/Astralchroma/Aggregator) - Forwards messages from channels which follow announcement channels to a singular target channel in order to circumvent Discord's 15 webhook per channel limitation.
- [Doomstom](https://github.com/Astralchroma/Doomstom) - Some hacky code to get the Java DOOM port "Mochadoom" running under Minestom.
