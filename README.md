Hey, I'm Astralchroma.

Honestly not sure what to put here lol

Active Projects (*main projects right now*):
- [Solarscape](https://solarscape.astralchroma.dev/) - Early development of a 3D Minecraft inspired space sci-fi multiplayer game.
- [Autochroma](https://github.com/Astralchroma/Autochroma) - Private use Discord bot featuring random modules, all ranging between useful and silly.

Side Projects (*small inactively maintained utility projects*):
- [Aggregator](https://github.com/Astralchroma/Aggregator) - Forwards messages from channels which follow announcement channels to a singular target channel in order to circumvent Discord's 15 webhook per channel limitation.
- [TcpOverQuic](https://github.com/Astralchroma/TcpOverQuic) - A very simple proxy that tunnels TCP connections through QUIC as a hacky solution for an unstable connection.

Previous Projects (*stuff previously worked on, since left, abandonded, or seen as complete*):
- [Ion](https://github.com/HorizonsEndMC/Ion) - A custom developed and maintained fork of Star Legacy's plugins. Stepped down as Admin / Lead Developer in May 2023.
- [Doomstom](https://github.com/Astralchroma/Doomstom) - Some hacky code to get the Java DOOM port "Mochadoom" running under Minestom.
